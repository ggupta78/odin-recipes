    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Mexican rice (sometimes referred to as Spanish rice or red rice in Tex-Mex cuisine), also known as arroz a la
      Mexicana, arroz Mexicano, or arroz rojo in Mexico, is a Mexican side dish made from white rice, tomato, garlic,
      onion, and perhaps other ingredients. Mexican rice is almost always eaten as a complement to other dishes such as
      mole, refried beans, rotisserie chicken, carne asada, picadillo, tacos, fried fish, fried chicken, chiles rellenos
      or vegetable soup.
      <br><br>
